# CMLM-LiShizhen

Our second Chinese Medicine Language Model (CMLM-LiShizhen) aims to possess a higher level of academic English proficiency. It is designed to have enhanced understanding of the therapeutic effects of medicinal substances and a flexible mindset for prescribing based on dialectical thinking. This model will be released in the future. Stay tuned for updates.

我们第二个中医大语言模型为CMLM-LiShizhen，旨在具有更强大的药物功用理解能力与灵活的处方辩证思维，将在后续发布，敬请期待。
